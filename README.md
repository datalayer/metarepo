# Îž Metarepo for Datalayer

This repository is a scaffolding that allows to simultaneously develop on multiple repositories. It will clone  a list of independent repositories under the `package` folder and will create with [Lerna.js](https://lerna.js.org) the needed links so a change in `repository x` will be visible by `repository y`.

This is particularly useful for JavaScript and TypeScript based projects, and we use it at Datalayer to simultaneously develop on many JupyterLab extensions (mixed Typescript and Python repositories).

For now, we don't intend to add `git submodule` related features, although this is being discussed in https://github.com/datalayer/metarepo/issues/2.

## Requirements

The primary usage at Datalayer being JupyterLab development, we rely on [Yarn 3](https://yarnpkg.com) and Python. We have prepared a Conda environment to get you started. You will need [MiniConda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

```bash
# Create and activate the environment.
conda env create -y -n datalayer -f ./environment.yml
conda activate datalayer
```

[MicroMamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html) is an alternative to Conda.

```bash
# Create and activate the environment.
micromamba env create -y -n datalayer -f ./environment.yml
micromamba activate datalayer
```

## Usage

```bash
# Clone the metarepo repository.
git clone https://github.com/datalayer/metarepo.git
cd metarepo
```

Update the [metarapo](https://github.com/datalayer/metarepo/blob/main/metarepo#L10) file to list the public and private repositories you intend to work on.

Review the `patches` folder and put there any patch you would need for the `node_modules` packagesd.

```bash
# Clone the listed repositories.
./metarepo clone
```

```bash
# Install and build.
yarn
yarn build
```

```bash
# Watch.
yarn
yarn build
```

Add any other command in the root `package.json`.

Happy metarepo! ðŸš€
